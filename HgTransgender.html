    <p>This document will provide you with evidence on hg's ultimate downfall and rise of a new villain.</p>
    <h3><u>Hg's initial relationship with Dardy</u></h3>
    <p>Before everything happened, hg and dardy were a happy couple. ( Do not ask me how they met )</p>
    <img src="hgtransgender1.jpg" width="300" alt="HgTransgender Logo">
    <p>They lived a happy life in the world of discord and married just a few weeks after they met. They even started a server called " TGE Coruscant" which then Dardy was the Owner and hg as the Co Owner. </p>
    <h3><u>Hg's Ultimate Downfall</u></h3>
    <p>However, things took a turn. Well, bad for hg. 2 months after the server release, dardy started to pick out hg's mistakes according to oozo. Dardy together with the ISB members started on a document regarding hg's abuse of power and his other corruption actions. A month later, hg made a grave mistake and thus dardy and oozo called him out. That lead to his ultimate downfall, a demotion in that server to a mere 05. Hg was mad and so he left the server. The news headquarters have been digging out the background of the three of them hg, dardy and oozo and found out that dardy was cheating with oozo on hg! Despite their recent marriage, dardy decided to just cheat on hg? Unbelievable. This made hg even more upset and therefore he started complaining about oozo in my dms.
    There has been several incidents on this however if you want them just dm me i will personally send you the photos. Honestly at this point i do not blame him as the dardy had betrayed him. Then, his villain arc showed.</p>
    <h3><u>Hg's Villain Arc</u></h3>
    <p>Above was the reason why he turned to the dark side. Recently, there has been footage of him being a girl and caught him in bed with a slender boy! He must have been so depressed he really had to result to this… The one with him on bed was Christian, a boy he met and christian supposedly had a planned marriage with max, but shortly after was cancelled because they found out that they both are male and they do not support gay marriages (W by the way). However, hg took that idea and approached Jrocks, a plaatic surgery doctor which will turn hg into a girl figure. Jrocks was known to be cheating on his wife too and hg had that information to threaten jrocks into this transgender process. Jrocks did jot want his wife to know about him cheating so he reluctantly agreed to. Afterwards, hg approached christian and started having affairs with christian with proof here.</p>

    <p>Both of them had a fantastic time together and therefore we can confirm that hg transgendered. Lets just hope hg can come to his senses…</p>
